    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a postdoctoral researcher modeling galaxies for future surveys, such as Roman, with a 
      focus on accurate modeling of emission lines and calibrating models using the Semi-Analytic Model Galacticus. 
      My other research interests are modeling dwarf satellites of the Milky Way and Centaurus A, and exploring the
      impact of major mergers on stellar streams and their properties.

    <h3>Modeling Emission Lines</h3>

    <p>
      Currently, I am developing the emission line (EL) modeling in <code>GALACTICUS</code>.
      Emission from young hot stars and AGN can ionize surrounding gas, creating `HII regions'
      and `narrow line regions'. These ELs probe the SFH, gas metallicity, gas density, and 
      AGN activity. Star-forming galaxies at high redshift occupy a locus shifted to 
      higher [OIII]/Hβ ratios than SDSS galaxies at z~0, a trend 
      established across samples from hundreds (Shapley+2015,Strom+2017) to 
      thousands of systems (Kashino+2019). With current JWST surveys and upcoming missions 
      such as Roman and LSST set to deliver millions of emission-line galaxies, it is both 
      critical and timely to refine theoretical models of ELs for interpreting these datasets 
      and testing our understanding of galaxy evolution.<br>
      I have implemented an improved model 
      for emission line luminosities in HII regions using <code>CLOUDY</code> (Ferland+2017)
      for star-forming galaxies. The luminosities of HII regions are characterized by parameters
      including hydrogen density, interstellar metallicity, ionizing photon rates, and elemental
      and dust abundances (Gutkin+2016). Notably, this model approximately reproduces the
      observed H&alpha,[NII],[OII] luminosity functions (Favole+2024), and agree with galaxy 
      EL ratios at cosmic noon (Strom+2017,Raptis+2025). I have further developed a AGN EL model to
      predict narrow-line region emission. What's unique about this model is the ability to connect
      emission line ratios and other properties of galaxies to better understand their behavior. 
      Our models reproduce the observed black hole accretion rates (Vazquez+2025).
      I am facilitating further comparison of models to observations of SFR distributions, 
      black hole mass--velocity dispersion relations (Robotham+2011,McConnel&Ma2013). My models will support
      surveys uncovering millions of emission line galaxies.

    <h3>Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Volume <span>(Weerasooriya et al. 2023,2024)</span></h3>
    <p>
      My Ph.D. thesis began exploration of the dependence of the SF physics of dwarf galaxies on the environment
      by modeling dwarf galaxies of the MW and an intermediate mass-environment (Cen A) using <code>Galacticus</code>.
      SAMs formulate galaxy physics onto a dark matter-only N-body simulation, are computationally inexpensive, and
      allow us to explore this massive system's parameter space rapidly.

    <h3>Stellar Streams <span>(Weerasooriya et al. 2024)</span></h3>
    <p>
      Stellar streams are the remnants of disrupted globular clusters or dwarf galaxies—are recognized as tracers
      of galactic structure and evolution. These streams offer valuable insights into the gravitational potential 
      and assembly history of galaxies. We explore how a population of stellar streams evolves in response to a 
      major perturbation, such as a galaxy merger. See here for more details.
